    RAM, so the pass does not fail, it crawls, with nothing on screen to explain why. This is the
    one place that can see it: free VRAM measured AFTER the encoder is resident.

    Thresholds are measured, not guessed (tests/diag_minimax_te_peak.py, nvfp4 encoder, 42-token
    captions): resident 12.78 GB, and the forward peaks 1.64 GB above that at batch 1 rising to
    only 1.87 GB at batch 16. The spike is the per-forward nvfp4 dequant of 351 weights, so it is
    almost independent of the batch — dropping the batch buys ~0.2 GB, not gigabytes. Which makes
    it a last-ditch lever rather than the fix, and worth pulling only inside that 1.9 GB band
    where a fifth of a gigabyte decides whether the card pages.

    with_vision changes what the advice can honestly be. Those 12.78 GB assume cpu_embed, which
    the vision build forces off (embedder.py: it scatters image embeddings from input_ids, so
    inputs_embeds would drop the pixels) — the ~1.5 GB embedding table comes back onto the card,
    and that is the entire margin 16 GB has. Telling someone in that state to close their browser
    sends them looking for memory nothing else is holding (issue #71: 15.3 GB resident, 0.0 free,
