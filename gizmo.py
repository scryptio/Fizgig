"""Gizmo — the clip prep tool for Fizgig.

MiniMax H3 trains on video clips, and clips have to be exactly right: 24 fps, a frame count on
H3's 17n+5 grid, dimensions on a multiple of 32, audio at 32 kHz stereo. Fizgig refuses anything
off-spec rather than quietly fixing it, because a training app that silently transcodes footage
makes two identical-looking datasets train differently and nobody can tell why.

That leaves someone with an hour of source video and a spec sheet. Gizmo is the answer: open a
video, scrub to a moment, pick a length, save. Out comes a clip Fizgig accepts. Six sections from
one source is six marks and six clicks, and there is no project file to manage — mark, save,
repeat, close.

It is deliberately a separate app:

  * It keeps ffmpeg transcoding out of the training path, where it does not belong.
  * It opens in under a second, because it imports no torch and never touches Fizgig's GUI.

Two things it will NOT do, both on purpose:

  * It does not write a still beside each clip. That was the original design and it is wrong:
    Fizgig's latent cache keys on the filename stem with the extension stripped, so walk_03.mp4
    and walk_03.png collide on the same cache file and one silently overwrites the other.
  * It does not caption. Captioning happens in Fizgig afterwards, on the whole folder at once,
    which is also why muting is a filename suffix — there are no .txt files yet to keep in sync.

Run: venv/Scripts/pythonw.exe gizmo.pyw    (or the Launch Gizmo .bat, or from Fizgig's Image Prep)

# fizgig.minimax.model, which pulls in torch, and a prep tool that takes ten seconds to open
# because it loaded CUDA would be a bad tool. tests/test_gizmo_spec.py asserts the two agree, so

# What each length can be TRAINED at, by card: frames -> {free VRAM in GB: largest training
# megapixels}. None means that card cannot do it at all.
#
# Two ceilings, and the lower one wins.
#
# The TRAINING step comes from Fizgig's own swap planner (trainer.plan_vram) rather than from
# guesswork, by feeding a clip's token load in as the equivalent megapixel value — which is
# arithmetically what it is. Its activation term is linear in tokens while attention is
# quadratic, and it was anchored on stills of 256-1024 tokens, so at the long lengths it is an
# extrapolation and where it is wrong it will be optimistic. That is what sets the LENGTH limits
# here, and the long ones still want a real run behind them.
#
# The CACHING pass is measured, on a 5090 with ~30 GiB free, encoding in 17-frame groups:
#
#     0.25 MP  ~14.2 GiB      0.5 MP  ~23.2 GiB      1.0 MP  out of memory
#
# Flat in clip length — 124 frames costs the same as 22 — because the groups bound it. That is
# what sets the MEGAPIXEL limits: 1 MP is unreachable for clips of any length on a 32 GB card,
# and 0.25 MP at ~14 GiB is already marginal on a 16 GB one. Caching is fp32 today; the file is
# natively fp16, which measures 8.05 GiB and 0.09% different, so these could move.
#
# Frozen into a table because Gizmo must not import the trainer — that would pull torch in
# behind it, and a prep tool that takes ten seconds to open because it loaded CUDA is a bad tool.

    Frame RATE is where a dataset goes quietly wrong, so it is worth being explicit about the two

      fps=24 preserves wall-clock time — it drops or duplicates so one real second stays one
      second. That keeps motion at true speed from any source (60 fps drops roughly every 2.5th
      frame, 25 fps drops 1 in 25) and it normalises the variable frame rate that most phone
      video has. It is the default and needs no decision from the user.

      select+setpts KEEPS every k-th source frame and re-times them to 24 fps, which plays back
      slower than life: 60 fps at every 2nd frame is 1.25x slow, 120 fps at every 2nd is 2.5x.
      This is the opposite of the intuition — it CREATES slow motion rather than avoiding it — so
      it is only ever offered as an explicit choice against the detected source rate.

    Audio is trimmed by atrim rather than left to -shortest, which decides on stream ends and can
    hand back a track a few samples long or short. Fizgig pads and trims the waveform to the frame
    count anyway, so this is belt and braces — but the belt is cheap.

    needs nothing Fizgig does not already have.

    Tk has no drag-and-drop, so the window procedure is subclassed to catch WM_DROPFILES. THE
    RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE: the procedure must not touch Tk. Not one call.

    That rule was learned the hard way. The first version marshalled the path with root.after,

        Fatal Python error: PyEval_RestoreThread: the function must be called with the GIL held
        ... the GIL is released (the current Python thread state is NULL)

    Tk's mainloop sits inside Tcl with the GIL released. A drop arrives, Windows dispatches into
    the window procedure, and root.after re-enters Tcl from underneath the loop already running
    it. The ctypes callback was never the problem — one that only touches plain Python is fine,
    which is what this does: append the path to a list, and let an ordinary Tk timer, running
    where Tk expects to be running, pick it up.

    None of this reproduces with a synthesised drop sent from inside root.update(), because then
    Python is already executing and Tcl is not mid-loop. It has to be POSTED and left to arrive
    on an idle mainloop, exactly as Explorer's does.

    """The push-to-record window.

    The mic rolls CONTINUOUSLY while this window is open (one ffmpeg writing raw PCM);
    holding the button — or the R key — only marks timestamps, and the take is sliced out
    afterwards with cushions either side. That is what makes push-to-record clip nothing:
    the capture was already running when the thumb landed.

    A CARD, not a popup (Peter): this swaps in for the Voice tab's Source recording card and
    Done swaps it back out. The popup lost its takes when it closed; a hidden card keeps
    them — leave record mode, come back, and the takes list is exactly as you left it. It
    also dissolves the popup's focus problem outright: everything lives in the main window,
    where the R binding already routes.

    R, not space and not Shift (Peter): space already means too much — it is the transport on
    both main tabs and Tk's activate key for any focused widget — and Shift walks into
    Windows' accessibility traps (five presses pops the Sticky Keys prompt, an 8 s hold pops
    Filter Keys). R is easy to find without looking, means record, and does nothing else
    here. Bound by both keysyms so Caps Lock cannot un-bind it.
